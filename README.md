🔧 Configuration
Gold Pricing
Current Rate: ₹6,500 per gram (configurable via environment variable)

Calculation: gold_grams = amount / GOLD_PRICE_PER_GRAM

Precision: Rounded to 4 decimal places

Session Management
Storage: In-memory dictionary (upgradeable to Redis)

Session ID: UUID4 generation for unique identification

Scoring: Tracks gold investment interest (triggers nudging at score ≥ 2)

Persistence: Conversation context maintained across API calls

🎯 Business Logic
Intent Detection Flow
Keyword Analysis: Checks for gold-related terms

LLM Processing: GPT-4o analyzes conversation context

Response Generation: Personalized advice with Indian market focus

Engagement Scoring: Tracks user interest level

Purchase Nudging: Suggests buying after demonstrated interest

Purchase Workflow
User Validation: Email, phone, name validation

User Management: Create new or retrieve existing user
